## Issues:
#### 1. No Reentrancy Protection:
 The original code lacks a reentrancy guard, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks where an external contract could repeatedly call the withdraw function before it completes, leading to unexpected behavior.

#### 2. No Overflow/Underflow Checks: 
There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow, leaving the contract vulnerable to arithmetic issues if the balance exceeds the maximum representable value or goes below zero.

## Changes Made:
#### 1. Reentrancy Guard Added:
A reentrancy guard pattern has been implemented in both the deposit and withdraw functions to prevent reentrancy attacks.

#### 2. Overflow/Underflow Checks Added: 
Explicit checks for integer overflow and underflow have been included to ensure the contract's arithmetic operations are secure.
